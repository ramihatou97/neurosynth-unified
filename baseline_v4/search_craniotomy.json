A no. 1 Kerrison rongeur is used to cut through all sublaminar soft tissue structures that are inhibiting the lamina from opening (▶ Fig. 3.3). The con- tralateral unicortical trough is created just lateral to the junc- tion of the lamina and facet joints. Careful attention must be made to not violate the ventral cortical wall on this side. Pre- operative CT scans may help estimate the thickness of the bony anatomy at this level. Following trough creation, the lamino- plasty doors are opened carefully. A greenstick fracture is cre- ated on the unicortical trough side.

The posterior frontotemporal approach is used for a lesion involving the anterior portion of the temporal horn that can be exposed through an anterior temporal lobectomy or a small cortical incision in the anterior part of the temporal lobe or a lesion involving the third ventricle extends laterally below the temporal lobe. The patient is placed in the supine position with a sandbag under the shoulder on the side to be operated. The head is tilted a bit backward and turned 45 degrees away from the side of the operation. The scalp incision begins in the frontal area and extends in a question-mark configuration back to the area above the ear and then downward to the zygoma in front of the ear. The scalp, temporalis muscle and fascia, and pericranium are reflected as a single layer. A free frontotemporal bone flap that will expose the anterior half of the lateral surface of the temporal lobe is elevated, and the lateral aspect of the sphenoid ridge is removed with a rongeur or a drill. The dura mater is opened with the main flap pulled anteroinferior along the region of the pterion. The tip of the temporal lobe may be elevated to expose the edge of the tentorium cerebelli. The temporal lobe may be elevated in the subtemporal approach to expose as far posterior as the anterior and lateral aspect of the midbrain and the upper part of the basilar artery. The tumor, once exposed, is removed according to the principles outlined previously. A decision is made as to whether to enter the temporal horn through a cortical incision or through a temporal lobectomy. The cortical incision would be selected if the lesion is strictly localized to the region of the tip of the temporal lobe. The temporal lobectomy would be considered if the lesion not only involved the temporal pole but also extended into the temporal horn. For the transcortical approach, the lower part of the middle temporal gyrus or the upper part of the inferior temporal gyrus is opened in the long axis of the gyrus and the incision is directed backward through the temporal lobe to the anterior part of the temporal horn. To use a temporal lobectomy, the vertical incision through the temporal lobe would be situated no more than 4 cm from the Rhoton's Cranial Anatomy and Surgical Approaches ISBN: 9780781793414 | 1st_Edition mcm999 | 130.113.111.210 | 23 October 2025 16:56:46 Utc temporal tip to avoid the optic radiations; the horizontal incision paralleling the sylvian fissure is directed medially through the lower part of the superior temporal gyrus or the upper part of the middle temporal gyrus.","summary":null,"title":"","chunk_type":"procedure","page_start":null,"entity_names":[],"image_ids":[],"authority_score":1.0,"keyword_score":0.0,"semantic_score":0.010769230769230769,"final_score":0.010769230769230769,"document_title":"Chapter 1_ Operative Techniques and Instrumentation for Neurosurgery","cuis":[],"images":[]}],"total_candidates":15,"query":"craniotomy surgical approach","mode":"hybrid","search_time_ms":827}
