{"answer":"Based on the provided context, the pterional approach is a frontotemporal craniotomy technique used for accessing certain third ventricular tumors and related structures.\n\n## Definition and Alternative Names\nThe pterional approach is also referred to as the frontotemporal approach [1]. It is one of the lateral approaches directed through the lower part of the lateral hemispheric surface [1].\n\n## Indications\nThe pterional approach may be selected for:\n- Removal of some third ventricular tumors [1]\n- Tumors involving the third ventricle that are centered lateral to the sella or extend into the middle cranial fossa [1]\n- Lesions involving the third ventricle that extend into the interval between the optic nerve and carotid artery or between the carotid artery and oculomotor nerve [2]\n\n## Patient Positioning\nThe patient is placed in the supine position with the head tilted slightly backward and turned 30 degrees away from the side of operation [1].\n\n## Surgical Technique\n\n### Craniotomy\nSmall scalp and bone flaps are elevated for the frontotemporal (pterional) approach [1]. The scalp, temporalis muscle and fascia, and pericranium may be reflected as a single layer, though more commonly an interfascial approach is used where these structures are reflected in two separate layers [1].\n\n### Key Anatomical Steps\n1. The lateral aspect of the sphenoid ridge is removed with a rongeur or drill [1]\n2. The dura is opened with the main flap pulled down anteroinferiorly along the region of the pterion [1]\n3. The frontal and temporal lobes are elevated to expose the area along the sphenoid ridge [1]\n4. Bridging veins from the sylvian fissure and temporal tip are coagulated and divided only if necessary [1]\n\n### Exposure and Access\nThe arachnoid membrane is opened to expose the carotid artery, optic nerve, and origin of the posterior communicating and anterior choroidal arteries [1]. The tumor is exposed through the triangle between the optic nerve and the internal carotid and anterior cerebral arteries [1]. The third ventricle may be entered through the floor if the nuclear masses are pushed laterally by the tumor and the floor consists of only a glial membrane [1].\n\n## Vascular Considerations\nIt may be possible to preserve bridging veins if the frontotemporal approach is entirely above the sphenoid ridge [1], which is an important consideration for minimizing surgical morbidity.\n\nThe pterional approach provides access to critical neurovascular structures while maintaining a relatively small craniotomy, making it suitable for selected third ventricular pathology with specific anatomical relationships.","citations":[{"index":1,"chunk_id":"1","snippet":"The lateral approaches directed through the lower part of the lateral hemispheric surface or below the lateral hemispheric border are the frontotempor...","document_id":"1053bc3d-3ebb-4588-81d7-31934cf6e108","page_number":null,"chunk_type":"procedure"},{"index":2,"chunk_id":"2","snippet":"The occipital transtentorial approach is preferred for tumors centered at or above the tentorial edge if there is not a major extension of tumor to th...","document_id":"1053bc3d-3ebb-4588-81d7-31934cf6e108","page_number":null,"chunk_type":"procedure"},{"index":3,"chunk_id":"3","snippet":"The operative approaches to the lateral ventricles are divided into anterior, posterior, and inferior approaches (Fig. 5.21).","document_id":"1053bc3d-3ebb-4588-81d7-31934cf6e108","page_number":null,"chunk_type":"procedure"},{"index":4,"chunk_id":"4","snippet":"The approaches suitable for lesions in the posterior part of the lateral and third ventricles are the posterior transcortical, posterior transcallosal...","document_id":"1053bc3d-3ebb-4588-81d7-31934cf6e108","page_number":null,"chunk_type":"procedure"},{"index":5,"chunk_id":"5","snippet":"This approach is not suitable for reaching a lesion in the region of the posterior part of the frontal horn near the foramen of Monro, in the floor of...","document_id":"1053bc3d-3ebb-4588-81d7-31934cf6e108","page_number":null,"chunk_type":"procedure"},{"index":6,"chunk_id":"6","snippet":"This approach, directed through a cortical incision in the superior parietal lobule, exposes the interior of the atrium and the posterior part of the...","document_id":"1053bc3d-3ebb-4588-81d7-31934cf6e108","page_number":null,"chunk_type":"procedure"},{"index":7,"chunk_id":"7","snippet":"It is possible to slip beneath such tumors as meningiomas in the trigone by this route, after partially debulking them, to pick up the medial blood su...","document_id":"1053bc3d-3ebb-4588-81d7-31934cf6e108","page_number":null,"chunk_type":"procedure"},{"index":8,"chunk_id":"8","snippet":"This approach is best suited to lesions that extend upward from the atrium or third ventricle through the posterior part of the splenium or that arise...","document_id":"1053bc3d-3ebb-4588-81d7-31934cf6e108","page_number":null,"chunk_type":"procedure"},{"index":9,"chunk_id":"9","snippet":"The third ventricle may be entered through the floor if the nuclear masses are pushed laterally by the tumor and the floor consists of only a glial me...","document_id":"1053bc3d-3ebb-4588-81d7-31934cf6e108","page_number":null,"chunk_type":"procedure"},{"index":10,"chunk_id":"10","snippet":"Rhoton's Cranial Anatomy and Surgical Approaches ISBN: 9780781793414 | 1st_Edition mcm999 | 130.113.111.","document_id":"1053bc3d-3ebb-4588-81d7-31934cf6e108","page_number":null,"chunk_type":"procedure"}],"used_citations":[{"index":1,"chunk_id":"1","snippet":"The lateral approaches directed through the lower part of the lateral hemispheric surface or below the lateral hemispheric border are the frontotempor...","document_id":"1053bc3d-3ebb-4588-81d7-31934cf6e108","page_number":null,"chunk_type":"procedure"},{"index":2,"chunk_id":"2","snippet":"The occipital transtentorial approach is preferred for tumors centered at or above the tentorial edge if there is not a major extension of tumor to th...","document_id":"1053bc3d-3ebb-4588-81d7-31934cf6e108","page_number":null,"chunk_type":"procedure"}],"images":[],"question":"What is the pterional approach?","context_chunks_used":10,"generation_time_ms":16380,"search_time_ms":5421,"total_time_ms":21802,"model":"claude-sonnet-4-20250514"}
